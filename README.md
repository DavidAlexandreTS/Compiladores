# Compilers â€“ Course Implementations

This repository contains the main implementations and exercises developed during my **Compilers course**. The focus of the course was to understand and build the fundamental components of a compiler, with all code written in **C and C++** for performance and low-level control.

## What I Learned:

Throughout the course, I gained practical and theoretical knowledge in:

- **Lexical analysis**: construction of a lexer (tokenizer) using finite automata and regular expressions
- **Syntax analysis**: building parsers using context-free grammars and parsing techniques (LL, LR)
- Grammar design and ambiguity resolution
- Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and symbol tables
- Error handling and recovery techniques
- The general structure and phases of a compiler (lexical, syntactic, semantic, etc.)

## Technologies Used:
- C / C++
- Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator)
- Bison (GNU Parser Generator)
- GCC toolchain

## Key Takeaway:

This course provided deep insights into how programming languages are processed and understood by machines. By implementing both a **lexer** and a **parser** from scratch, I developed a solid foundation in formal language theory, compiler architecture, and systems programming.

The contents of this repository reflect my ability to work close to the hardware level, while applying theoretical principles to practical compiler construction.
